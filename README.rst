ARK Addons
==========

This is a Django project to obtain statistical information from
an `ARK`_ (Archaeological Recording Kit) project.
It is aimed to mine data from archaeological databases and create customizable
visualizations, querying both text and geographical data.
It consists of separate tools, each one is a (documented) Django app; 
they could be activated independently (although it could be useful 
to use them all together).
